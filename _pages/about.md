I am currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University, China. Before that, I received the B.S. degree in Internet of Things in 2022 and the M.S. degree in Software Engineering in 2025, both from Beijing University of Technology, China. My research interests include mobile edge computing, task scheduling, intelligent optimization algorithms, and deep learning. I received the Best Paper Award in 2024 ICAIS & ISAS [certificate](https://ZiqiWang0312.github.io/bio/files/ISAScer.pdf) and the Best Application Paper Award in the 21st IEEE ICNSC [certificate](https://ZiqiWang0312.github.io/bio/files/ICNSCcer.pdf).
